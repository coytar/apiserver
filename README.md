# API Server

This is an example API server that uses lowdb (local file database).

FYI, I created this project using the express generator ("npx express-generator") and then modified the files as necessary.

## Usage

You'll need  a recent version of Node installed. I tested it using v14.15.5.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "npm start"

Also, if you're using VSCode then install this REST client (search for "humao.rest-client" in VSCode extensions) and open the apitest.rest file to execute the HTTP requests within VSCode.
